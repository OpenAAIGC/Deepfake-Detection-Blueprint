## 🧠 **Changing the Model**

Given the structure of the blueprint, there's a lot of headroom for swapping (or adding new) models- since the video modality is frame-wise and the other visualizers besides class activation map (and naturally, another CNN would be the easiest fit for the GradCAM setup) are architecture-agnostic, there's little work needed to adapt other popular choices out of the box.
